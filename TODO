o = todo
X = done
? = maybe but not likely
M = more testing
I = in progress
W = waiting on other work

M  make changing skin/color force the proper color instead of kicking
M  make sure team/color is cleared when a client connects
o  allow lay mode if purchased
o  various drop items
X  move from *preqcc to cpp
o  add more variety to tinkering
o  add a way to edit the respawn ammo entities
X  add localinfo string for bottom half of the MOTD
X  add a define to disable abusive admin commands (eg stuffcmd)
X  the thief skill should set the "invisible" face
o  "slave teslas"
o  instead of not allowing two fastest legs when upgraded, restrict the health/armor you're allowed when you have fast legs
o  make a seperate menu for detonating engineer buildings
o  remove RPrint, since it's really kinda pointless and just makes the code uglier
o  change the color defines (eg DARKBLUE) to be the exact number, not number + 1
o  remove the old method for teleports checking if blocked, after confirming it's not needed.  (moving platforms block it?)
o  only allow people to use certain topcolors
o  allow more variation in skins
o  Make it so '1' repairs/reloads on all building menus
o  Teammates should be able to destroy fieldgens when they've been hacked to hurt teammates
o  Possibly berserker shouldn't make detpacks do more damage
o  give airborn pipebombs a different death message
o  Health should be given automatically based on the amount of money you have left.  That'd get rid of the "can't undo health" problem
o  Hitting 0 when customizing should give you a confirmation screen, instead of exiting immedietly
o  Make 50 frag (upgrade from frags?  maybe not) teslas change color or do something special.  (not yellow though, as that can happen normally)
o  Medikits should trigger buttons
o  Fix Sentry movement on platforms.  (Make the top the only real entity, and the bottom one purely visual and adjusted to match it's position every frame)
