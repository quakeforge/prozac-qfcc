I  make changing skin/color force the proper color instead of kicking

o  allow lay mode if purchased
o  various drop items
X  move from *preqcc to cpp
o  add more variety to tinkering

o  add localinfo string for bottom half of the MOTD
o  add a define to disable abusive admin commands (eg stuffcmd)
o  the thief skill should set the "invisible" face
o  "slave teslas"
o  instead of not allowing two fastest legs when upgraded, restrict the health/armor you're allowed when you have fast legs
o  make a seperate menu for detonating engineer buildings
o  remove RPrint, since it's really kinda pointless and just makes the code uglier
