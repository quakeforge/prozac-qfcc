- info string length exceeded :/
- duplicate connects
- the map cycler (including if you set nmap) just sit there if it doesn't change map.  instead, it should have failsafe behavior
- "has_sentry" should be a counter, not a flag (allows a second build if you hack and it gets roasted)
- there appears to be a window between when a teamkill curse respawn is disabled and when they're killed.  it should be removed.
- through some combination of respawning, respawn guard, and teleporters (not necesarily needed), it's possible to get stuck on another person
- if you build your teleporter too close to a wall, and it blows up, you get "tried to sprint to a non-client"
- hacked forcefields get you teamkills
- the "speed cheat" checker needs to be ripped out, it's kinda useless
