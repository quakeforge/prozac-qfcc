- info string length exceeded :/
- duplicate connects
- the map cycler (including if you set nmap) just sit there if it doesn't change map.  instead, it should have failsafe behavior
- "has_sentry" should be a counter, not a flag (allows a second build if you hack and it gets roasted)
- there appears to be a window between when a teamkill curse respawn is disabled and when they're killed.  it should be removed.
- through some combination of respawning, respawn guard, and teleporters (not necesarily needed), it's possible to get stuck on another person
- the "speed cheat" checker needs to be ripped out, it's kinda useless
- sometimes rockets go through armor..
- crashed alot on prozac :/
- I could jump at a sentry turret but I went through instead of zapping
- the sentry turret would shoot me through walls when the door is closed
- intercepting your sentry when it turrets kills you, but stops the sentry
- if you judo an assault cannon your speed isn't restored when it's returned
- I've been told that if you're a thief and you start setting a detpack you won't get revealed until it's finished
- sentries/teslas should check their pointcontents every frame, and blow up if they're out of the map. "foo had a lesson in physics"
- topcolor gets reset every time you respawn (?), even though it shouldn't be.  ditto for skin?
- prematch shouldn't force autoteam when it's done
- sometimes ID doesn't work.  this may be because impulses are unreliable though :/
- minp/maxp are broken.  possibly compiler !string bug
- rockets explode on observers
- scuba gear doesn't set the rad suit anymore
- I think getting a rad suit clears your scuba gear when it expires
- "hit to disguise to blue, then before it finishes stop disguising, then quick disguise to change your skin.......boop your color will finish disguising, then do another disguise (doesnt matter color/skin) then boop your skin will finish"
