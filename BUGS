- info string length exceeded :/
- duplicate connects
- the curse color is rejected by the color changing code
- the map cycler (including if you set nmap) just sit there if it doesn't change map.  instead, it should have failsafe behavior
- "has_sentry" should be a counter, not a flag (allows a second build if you hack and it gets roasted)
- there appears to be a window between when a teamkill curse respawn is disabled and when they're killed.  it should be removed.
